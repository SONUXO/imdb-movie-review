# ðŸŽ¬ Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews â€“ MLOps Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for performing sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. It covers every stage of the ML lifecycle: from data ingestion to model deployment and monitoring using modern MLOps tools and AWS services.

> ðŸ”’ Note: The service is currently deactivated to avoid AWS billing. However, the complete pipeline and configurations are preserved in the repository.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

| Area | Tool/Service |
|------|--------------|
| Programming | Python, Flask |
| Pipeline Orchestration | DVC |
| Model Tracking | MLflow |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Data & Model Storage | AWS S3 |
| Containerization | Docker + AWS ECR |
| Deployment | AWS EKS |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana on EC2 |

## ðŸ“¦ Pipeline Stages (from `dvc.yaml`)

Each stage is modular and reproducible:

1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ Load and split raw data.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Clean and tokenize data.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Convert text to vectorized format using `TfidfVectorizer`.
4. **Model Building** â€“ Train a classification model.
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Evaluate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and log with MLflow.
6. **Model Registration** â€“ Register the best model version with MLflow.
